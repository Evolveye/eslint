# My eslint configuration

I wanted Eslint to format my code as I wanted it to.
Unfortunately, the Eslint rules were not able to add everything what I wanted.
That's why I made this plugin and config.

Now I can install just one dev dependency from NPM, and all will be done!.
```
npm i eslint-config-eye
```

# Let's respect our eyes -- eslint code style config

This package provides configured eslint rules mostly for my -- Evolveye.
If you are interested in this code style, or if you want to propose changes -- 
just [start new discussion](https://github.com/Evolveye/eslint/discussions).



## Preconfigured babel and react


I wanted to create one module that could set all dependencies by itself.
And this is it! This config is seting up the Babel parser for JavaScript classes
(private fields, static fields, arrow methods),
and React for JSX (but JSX is not part of the React, IK).


## Eslint rules


I configured it only for me (because nobody other wanted to use it ),
so code style can be a little... It can be not for everybody, I know it.

Also, I made some custom rules. You can find them [here](../eslint-plugin-spaces)
